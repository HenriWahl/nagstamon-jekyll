The next testing release comes with tons of fixes and a newly introduced window mode:

Also new is the option to close the status window by clicking somewhere inside instead of hovering out or clicking the X button. This mode seemed the only escape to handle the problems Nagstamon has on Wayland on latest Fedora, but used on a daily basis has come out pretty practical.
