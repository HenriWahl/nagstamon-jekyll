During the last year a lot of contributions to Nagstamon contained many improvements and new features â€“ so many, that a new major version number is justified. The changes include:




* added **Kerberos authentification**

* added increased security by taking **TLS** seriously

* added **window mode**

* added large OK label for fullscreen and window mode

* added click-somewhere-to-close-statuswindow mode

* added custom views to Check_MK

* added monitor type Monitos3

* added monitor type SNAG-View 3

* added monitor type Sensu

* switched to pyinstaller



Also several fixes were necessary:




* fixes statuswindow garbage when changing mode

* fixed filename bug

* fixed check for .Xauthority file

* fixes for Centreon

* fixes for Check_MK 1.4.0

* fixes for Zabbix



The new TLS awareness surely will cause some trouble for users with self-signed certificates or those whose CA is not contained in the certificate store coming with Nagstamon. Please see [/how-to-solve-trouble-with-self-signed-certificates/](/how-to-solve-trouble-with-self-signed-certificates/) for details.
