After a major overhaul Nagstamon is finally available in its 2.0 incarnation. Being formerly formed of Python 2 and GTK 2 it now comes freshly reshaped, made of Python 3 and Qt 5. This technology shift caused the longer absence of any other stable release, but was absolutely necessary to make sure there will be future releases too.

These are some new features and fixes:


* Based on Qt 5 it now comes with a better integrated look-and-feel â€“ especially remarkable on MacOS

* Partly simplified design

* Runs even on latest Windows and MacOS

* Uses QT 5 multimedia which means native sound on Linux and MacOS

* Uses only SVG graphics â€“ allows changing colors even in systray icon

* Customizable font and font size

* Adjust to dark or light desktop theme

* Action allowing to copy host/service information to clipboard

* Added â€˜Archive Eventâ€™ action for Check_MK monitors

* Additionally supports IcingaWeb2

* Experimental support for Livestatus and Zenoss

* New build script based on cx-Freeze for Windows and MacOS

* Native 64 bit version for Windows
