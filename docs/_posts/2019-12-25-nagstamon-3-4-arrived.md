Finally a new stable version of Nagstamon is available. Its main changes were almost completely contributed by its community â€“ thank you for all the [pull requests](https://github.com/HenriWahl/Nagstamon/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)!  
Among the most notable improvements is the new feature of multiple hosts and services selection which makes applying actions on them even faster:
