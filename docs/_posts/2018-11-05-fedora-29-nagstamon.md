If anybody using Fedora also has problems when upgrading to 29 this trouble might be resolved with the testing version of Nagstamon: 


[/download/#testing](/download/#testing)  



If Fedora would update its Nagstamon package from 1.0 (which does not run anymore) to the current version this problem would not exist. See [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466709](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466709) for details.
