Thanks to the [efforts of the community](https://github.com/HenriWahl/Nagstamon/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+prometheus) the latest testing release of Nagstamon comes with experimental support for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring. This is a great addition, being another monitoring solution outside the Nagios derivative universe. Thanks!
