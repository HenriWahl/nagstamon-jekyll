Nagstamon 3.2 has a bug in its macOS version. Clicking the green icon in system tray (which way too seldomly appears) crashes the whole application. See [https://github.com/HenriWahl/Nagstamon/issues/530](https://github.com/HenriWahl/Nagstamon/issues/530).


This issue is fixed in the first testing version of this new year. Get it from [/download/#testing](/download/#testing).


**Edit:** This fix now became [stable release 3.2.1](/download/#stable).
