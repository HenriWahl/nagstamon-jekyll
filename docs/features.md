# Features

_This page will become a new incarnation of [https://nagstamon.ifw-dresden.de/features/](https://nagstamon.ifw-dresden.de/features/)._

## General

Nagstamon is permanently visible on your desktop to give you an overview about your systems status in several different appearances:

 - a freely **floating desktop statusbar**, easy to place anywhere by drag and drop:

 - or as **single window**:

## Statusbar

The statusbar automagically updates and shows a **quick summary** and a more descriptive status overview when being touched: 

- the status is indicated by colors for down/unreachable **hosts** and warning/critical/unknown **services**:
  
   ![statusbar](/assets/images/statusbar-1.png)

- additionally it displays hosts’/services’ status with **icons** if there are any special flags like **acknowledged**, **downtime**, **flapping** and **passive**:

- shown **colors** are even **customizable**:

## Context menu

The **context menu** provides fast access to the monitor page of failing hosts/services and to any remote service like SSH/RDP/VNC/whatever running on a host:

 - by clicking it at the status popup window:
