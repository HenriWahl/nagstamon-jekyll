It is inspired by [Nagios Checker for Firefox](https://web.archive.org/web/20151105174526/https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/nagios-checker/) â€“ just without an open Firefox window all the time to monitor the network.

Nagstamon is released under the [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) and free to use and modify.
