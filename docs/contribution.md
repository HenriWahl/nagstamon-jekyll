## Code

If you want to help with **code**, have a look at the [issues page at GitHub](https://github.com/HenriWahl/Nagstamon/issues).
Aside of open bugs there are also ideas for new features available.

## Documentation

The **web pages** could need some finish, especially in the documentation area. With GitHub Actions now being used to create
GitHub Pages it is now an option to switch to another Markdown-to-HTML renderer like Hugo.

## Donation

To help out with paying **code signing**, domain and mail, a **coffee** or donate in general just use **PayPal** and send
what you like to **coffee@nagstamon.de**
